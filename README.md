# üêö Nacar

Nacar is a tool for creating interactive text-based interfaces from user-defined blueprints.  
Say goodbye to remembering long, arcane shell commands!

**TODO: add side-by-side comparison video of a simple YAML blueprint and the resulting screen in bash.** 

You write a 'blueprint' of screens as a single YAML file, specifying the options and commands that should appear on each screen.
Additionally, you can link between screens for fluid keyboard-based navigation.  

Nacar will take that blueprint and produce a self-contained bash script containing your interface.

Tested on Python 3.7+
